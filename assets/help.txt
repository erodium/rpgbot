Welcome to lowerlight's RPGbot! It's nice to see you. This bot is made specifically for Pathfinder 2e.

You can use the bot as follows. There are two main methods of interacting with the bot:
commands that start with $ and commands that start with !

$ commands: These commands are for player interaction, or direct interaction with the bot. For example, use $ to $list your characters, $register a character, or $end a turn.
! commands: These commands are for meta-data about the game. For example, use !mode to find out if you're in downtime, or !date to find out when it is in game-time.

Currently, only the following commands are implemented.  If you would like to add or expedite implementation of a command, please message lowerlight.

Commands:
$hello - greet the bot
$roll NdX+MOD - Roll N dice with X sides, add MOD to the result. Follows the d20 syntax https://d20.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start.html#numbers

!help - See this message.
!mode - Find out what mode the game is currently in, whether downtime, exploration, or encounter mode.
